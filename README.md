## üìå Project Title:

**SecureAI Virus Scanning Portal: AI-driven Malware Detection and Reporting System**

## üìñ Abstract:

This project focuses on developing a web-based **Virus Scanning and Reporting Portal** that integrates traditional malware scanning (using VirusTotal API) with **AI-driven summarization** (OpenAI API). The solution allows users to upload files, receive detailed scan reports, get AI-generated threat summaries, and download professional PDF reports. This repository aims to help university, college, and school students explore cybersecurity and artificial intelligence concepts in real-world projects.

## üéØ Objectives:

* Enable students to understand how Virus Scanning APIs work.
* Integrate AI models for automated threat summarization.
* Allow secure user authentication and file handling in web apps.
* Generate downloadable PDF security reports.
* Provide a scalable LAMP-based deployment model.

```

## üß± Technology Stack:

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap
* **Backend:** PHP 8.x
* **Database:** MySQL / MariaDB
* **External APIs:**

  * VirusTotal API (for file scanning)
  * OpenAI API (for AI Summary)
* **PDF Report Generation:** TCPDF / DomPDF
* **Deployment:** Apache Server (XAMPP, LAMP, or Shared Hosting)

## üóÑÔ∏è MySQL Database Schema:

| Table Name    | Description                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------- |
| users         | User authentication data    |
| uploads       | Uploaded file metadata      |
| scan\_results | VirusTotal scan report data |
| ai\_summaries | AI-generated summaries      |
| logs          | Optional user activity logs |

## üîé Solution Overview:

1. **User Authentication:** Secure login/registration system with password hashing.
2. **File Upload:** Users upload files for malware scanning.
3. **VirusTotal API Integration:** The backend sends files for scanning and retrieves JSON-based scan reports.
4. **AI-Powered Summary:** OpenAI API generates a human-readable, risk-focused summary from scan results.
5. **Report Generation:** The system generates a downloadable PDF report.
6. **User Dashboard:** Users can view their upload history, scan results, and download past reports.

## üìç Development Phases:

| Phase   | Description                         |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Phase 1 | User Authentication Module          |
| Phase 2 | File Upload & Validation Module     |
| Phase 3 | VirusTotal API Scan Integration     |
| Phase 4 | AI Summary Integration (OpenAI API) |
| Phase 5 | PDF Report Generation               |
| Phase 6 | Dashboard UI for users              |
| Phase 7 | Deployment & Testing                |

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions:

### Requirements:

* PHP 8.x
