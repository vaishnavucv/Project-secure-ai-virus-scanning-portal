# Mitigation Design

Mitigation for **CVE-2023-46604 (Apache ActiveMQ Deserialization RCE)** focuses on minimizing the attack surface, isolating vulnerable services, and applying compensating controls in scenarios where patching or upgrading is not immediately possible. The following sections provide a comprehensive design with technical detail, configuration steps, and references.

---

## 1. General Approach
Since patching may not be available or practical in the short term, mitigation must ensure:
- Limiting exposure of vulnerable services (especially OpenWire on TCP/61616).
- Hardening the runtime environment to contain compromise.
- Introducing proactive defenses such as firewalls, containerization, and automated blocking.

---

## 2. Firewall and Network-Level Restrictions
### Steps:
1. **Restrict OpenWire Access** to trusted hosts only:
```bash
# Linux iptables example
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 61616 -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 61616 -j DROP
```
This configuration allows only internal hosts to connect while dropping external traffic.

2. **UFW Example (Ubuntu/Debian)**:
```bash
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 61616 proto tcp
sudo ufw deny 61616/tcp
```

## 3. Protocol Hardening
If OpenWire is not strictly required, disable it in ActiveMQ configuration.
### Steps:
1. Edit `activemq.xml` configuration file:
```xml
<transportConnectors>
    <!-- Disable OpenWire connector -->
    <!-- <transportConnector name="openwire" uri="tcp://0.0.0.0:61616"/> -->

    <!-- Keep only protocols in use, e.g., AMQP or MQTT -->
    <transportConnector name="amqp" uri="amqp://0.0.0.0:5672"/>
</transportConnectors>
```
2. Restart ActiveMQ service:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart activemq
```

## 4. Containerization and Sandboxing
Running ActiveMQ in a container or VM with restricted privileges limits damage if exploitation occurs.

### Steps:
1. **Dockerfile Example (Non-root)**:
```dockerfile
FROM rmohr/activemq:5.18.2

# Create non-root user
RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash activemquser
USER activemquser

EXPOSE 61616 8161
CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "/app/bin/activemq console"]
```

2. Apply **AppArmor** or **SELinux** profiles to restrict system calls.
3. Use Docker resource controls:
```bash
docker run -d --name activemq_vuln \
  --cpus="1" --memory="1g" \
  --security-opt no-new-privileges \
  activemq:vuln
```

## 5. Automated Blocking (Fail2ban)
### Steps:
1. Install fail2ban:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install fail2ban -y
```
2. Configure rule for ActiveMQ:
`/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`
```ini
[activemq]
enabled = true
port    = 61616
protocol = tcp
filter   = activemq
maxretry = 3
findtime = 600
bantime  = 3600
```
3. Define filter file `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/activemq.conf`:
```ini
[Definition]
failregex = .*java\.io\.StreamCorruptedException.*
ignoreregex =
```
4. Restart fail2ban:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```
This configuration auto-blocks IPs sending repeated malicious payloads.

## 6. Network Segmentation
### Steps:
1. Deploy ActiveMQ on a **dedicated VLAN**.
2. Restrict communication with **internal applications only**.
3. Apply ACLs on routers/firewalls to block unnecessary east-west traffic.

- Cisco VLAN Security Whitepaper: [https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/vlan/](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/vlan/)

---

## 7. Monitoring and Alerting
- Continuously monitor logs for exploit attempts.
- Integrate detection events (from IDS/IPS, Zeek, or fail2ban) into SIEM for real-time alerts.
- Mock SIEM alert:
```log
ALERT: ActiveMQ CVE-2023-46604 exploit attempt detected
Source IP: 203.0.113.45
Destination: 192.168.1.50:61616
Action: IP blocked via fail2ban
```

---

## Conclusion
Mitigating CVE-2023-46604 requires a **multi-layered approach**: restricting exposure through firewall rules, disabling or limiting vulnerable protocols, containerizing the broker, and deploying automated blocking mechanisms. By implementing the technical steps outlined above, organizations can effectively reduce the risk window until official patches are applied. These compensating controls provide practical, feasible, and original measures aligned with the project requirements.
